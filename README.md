  TonVault - decentralized storage protocol overview
---

# Overview

> TonVault is a Secure Vault for encrypted data powered by [Ton Storage](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/docs/participate/ton-storage).
> It allows Users to store their
> data in a private and decentralized way.
> All data stored as "torrent" files, which are encrypted and distributed across
> the TonVault's network overlay.

> The encryption process is facilitated through the User's favourite 
> TON wallet strictly on the client side, 
> allowing Users to confidently utilize their wallet 
> for encryption within TonVault.
> It is important to note that we
> do not request the User's private key or any other confidential 
> information. All that is required for data encryption 
> is a one-time signature generated by the User's wallet.

> Users have the option to deploy their own TonVault node
> and become participants in the network or utilize
> our public endpoint. 
> If User decides to set up own 
> TonVault node but encounters software/hardware malfunctions, 
> He can retrieve encrypted data from 
> our public endpoint (similar to IPFS). 
> However, decryption is only possible 
> if User retains control over encryption wallet.

> TonVault nodes communicate using the ADNL plus Ton Storage
> protocols, but for User convenience and seamless integration, 
> each node is equipped with an HTTP API.
