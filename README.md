  Secure vault for encrypted data powered by Ton Storage
---

# Overview

> Ton  Vault is a secure vault for user data powered by [TON Storage](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/docs/participate/ton-storage). It allows users to store their data in a private and decentralized way. All data stored as "torrent" files, which are encrypted and distributed across the Ton  Vault's network overlay.

> The encryption process is facilitated through the user's favorite TON wallet strictly on the client side, allowing users to confidently utilize their wallet for encryption within Ton  Vault. It is important to note that we do not request the user's private key or any other confidential information. All that is required for data encryption is a one-time signature generated by the user's wallet.

> Users have the option to deploy their own Ton Vault node and become participants in the network or utilize our public endpoint. If user decides to set up own Ton Vault node but encounters software/hardware malfunctions, he can retrieve encrypted data from our public endpoint (similar to IPFS). However, decryption is only possible if user retains control over encryption wallet.
